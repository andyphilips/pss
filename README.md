# pss
R package to perform bounds test for cointegration and perform dynamic simulations.

## Details
`pss` is an `R` package to perform the Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (2001) bounds test for cointegration and perform dynamic simulations of the resulting output.

Currently, only the bounds test function is operational (`pssbounds`); the dynamic function (`dynpss`) is still under development. For details on each of these programs, see http://andyphilips.github.io/pssbounds/ and http://andyphilips.github.io/dynpss/, respectively

NOTE: This package is under development. If any bugs are found, please direct them to the authors.
